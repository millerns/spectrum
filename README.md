An app for finding your favorites.

## Purpose
This app is a personal project I contribute to during my freetime for fun and to keep my skills sharp. If it turns out to actually be a practical, useful tool then all the better.

## App Description
The app lets you create a list of things. It then helps you sort those things into a properly ordered list. For example, say you wanted to create a list of your favorite fifty music albums of the year. Comparing fifty albums can be a difficult task to wrap your mind around. This app simplifies the mental load by instead offering you a series of binary decisions. After enough comparisons have been performed, it spits out your ordered list. And a fun time was had by all.

## Process
I will be trying to develop this as correctly and effectively as possible. I will lay out the general design initially, organising and prioritising features into rough releases. I will then start my development cycle. In each cycle, I will determine the features to be developed for that cycle. The features will be designed then implemented following TDD. Once the features are functional, the current version will be released and the cycle can begin anew. If I can sneak in some user testing, that would be just swell. All documentation will be accessible via the cryptically named "Documentation" folder.
